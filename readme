This is the set of resources for the deployment of a "stateless" application (hello-world in this case) in a HA mode.
Basically, I use 2 OCP clusters and deploy the same resources on both clusters.
the first cluster is of the following type: *.apps.<cluster-1>.melbourneopenshift.com
the second cluster is of the following type: *.apps.<cluster-2>.melbourneopenshift.com

Now to deploy apps in an HA fashion, we want the same DNS entry for both on the two different clusters.
For this, I use the sledgehammer (it could 100% be done more elegantly).

I modify the Ingress Controller Operator on each cluster to create for all apps an ha-apps.melbourneopenshift.com Custom Domain

Log into each of the two clusters
then type

oc edit ingresses.config/cluster -o yaml

replace the current 
spec:
  domain: apps.<cluster-X>.melbourneopenshift.com
   
with

spec:
  appsDomain: ha-apps.melbourneopenshift.com
  domain: apps.<cluster-X>.melbourneopenshift.com

Now, any app that will get deployed outside openshift namespaces will have by default a route named svc-name-namespace.ha-apps.melbourneopenshift.com

Ok now for the automation.
I created two Ansible-playbooks, one to create the entries for *.ha-apps.melbourneopenshift.com mapped to the 2 IP @s of the OCP clusters (<cluster-1> and <cluster-2>)
one to do any post hook required (typically a curl command to the relevant URL).

Those playbooks need to be organised into folders (these folders need to be under another folder otherwise ACM doesn't seem to pick up that there are a Prehook and Posthook
folder). In this demo, they are under the deploy folder.

From my experience you need a bit of time for the DNS entries to propagate, but after a few minutes the setup should work.
